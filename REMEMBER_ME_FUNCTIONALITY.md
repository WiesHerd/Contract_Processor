# Remember Me Functionality Implementation

## Overview

The "Remember Me" feature has been fully implemented to provide extended session durations for users who prefer to stay logged in longer. This feature enhances user experience while maintaining security standards.

## How It Works

### 1. User Interface
- **Checkbox**: Located on the sign-in form with label "Remember me"
- **Visual Indicator**: When active, shows "âœ“ Extended session active" in the user dropdown menu
- **Session Banner**: Displays appropriate timeout message based on remember me status

### 2. Session Duration Configuration

#### Standard Sessions (Remember Me: OFF)
- **Regular Users**: 20 minutes of inactivity
- **Admin Users**: 15 minutes of inactivity
- **Warning Time**: 2 minutes before timeout (1 minute for admins)

#### Extended Sessions (Remember Me: ON)
- **Regular Users**: 8 hours of inactivity
- **Admin Users**: 4 hours of inactivity  
- **Warning Time**: 5 minutes before timeout (2 minutes for admins)

### 3. Storage and Persistence
- **localStorage Key**: `rememberMe`
- **Values**: `'true'` when enabled, removed when disabled
- **Persistence**: Survives browser restarts and tab closures
- **Cleanup**: Automatically cleared on sign-out

### 4. Security Considerations
- **Session Extension**: Only extends the timeout duration, doesn't bypass authentication
- **Activity Monitoring**: Still tracks user activity and resets timers on interaction
- **Admin Restrictions**: Admin users get shorter extended sessions for security
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Remember me preference is cleared on explicit sign-out

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

1. **`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`**
   - Added `rememberMe` state to context
   - Reads preference from localStorage on initialization
   - Clears preference on sign-out

2. **`src/hooks/useSessionTimeout.ts`**
   - Added remember me configuration options
   - Extended session duration constants
   - Dynamic timeout calculation based on preference

3. **`src/App.tsx`**
   - Passes remember me preference to session timeout hook
   - Updates session banner message based on preference
   - Shows visual indicator in user dropdown

4. **`src/features/auth/SignIn.tsx`**
   - Stores remember me preference in localStorage
   - Maintains existing UI functionality

### Key Functions

```typescript
// AuthContext - Reading preference on startup
useEffect(() => {
  const storedRememberMe = localStorage.getItem('rememberMe') === 'true';
  setRememberMe(storedRememberMe);
  checkUser();
}, [checkUser]);

// Session timeout - Dynamic duration calculation
if (rememberMe) {
  sessionDuration = isAdmin ? REMEMBER_ME_ADMIN_SESSION_DURATION : REMEMBER_ME_SESSION_DURATION;
  warningTime = isAdmin ? REMEMBER_ME_ADMIN_WARNING_TIME : REMEMBER_ME_WARNING_TIME;
} else {
  sessionDuration = isAdmin ? ADMIN_SESSION_DURATION : SESSION_DURATION;
  warningTime = isAdmin ? ADMIN_WARNING_TIME : WARNING_TIME;
}
```

## User Experience

### For Regular Users
- **Standard**: 20-minute sessions with 2-minute warnings
- **Remember Me**: 8-hour sessions with 5-minute warnings
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication when extended sessions are active

### For Admin Users
- **Standard**: 15-minute sessions with 1-minute warnings
- **Remember Me**: 4-hour sessions with 2-minute warnings
- **Enhanced Security**: Shorter extended sessions for administrative access

### Session Banner Messages
- **Standard**: "For your security, you will be logged out after 20 minutes of inactivity."
- **Remember Me**: "For your security, you will be logged out after 8 hours of inactivity."
- **Admin Remember Me**: "For your security, you will be logged out after 4 hours of inactivity."

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive tests in `src/features/auth/__tests__/remember-me.test.ts` covering:
- Checkbox state management
- localStorage persistence
- Preference initialization
- Sign-out cleanup

## Security Notes

1. **No Authentication Bypass**: Remember me only extends session duration, doesn't bypass login
2. **Activity Monitoring**: Sessions still timeout based on user activity
3. **Admin Restrictions**: Administrative users get shorter extended sessions
4. **Explicit Cleanup**: Preference is cleared when users explicitly sign out
5. **Browser Security**: Relies on localStorage which is cleared when browser data is cleared

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Secure token-based remember me (instead of localStorage)
- Configurable session durations per user role
- Remember me expiration dates
- Multi-device session management
